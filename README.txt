Hw3: Paint App
12/1/15

The concept behind this hw was very insteresting. As recommended on the hw3 page I started following the tutorials on the official Qt website. It is worth mentioning that Qt Creator really wasted a good amount of my time. It crashed every 15-30 minutes. (I attached some screenshots). Due to that reason I had to reimplement portion of my for couple of times. I added most of the functionalities except the brush and eraser and redo, unfortunately due to the lack of personal time. I also attached a screenshot for each functionality.

Morever, I added some extra features such as Print functionality and save image as different 18 different formats functionality.  Also The Paint window can be resized by dragging the cursor from corners of the main window. Also if the current image, drawing is modified and user wants to quit the app, it will double check with the user that this file has modified and gives user the options to either save or don't have and quit.
